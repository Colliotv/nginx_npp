Words1
======

If you would like to view or edit the keywords contained in the Words1 
list, I have provided them here for your convenience. This file has no 
functional purpose. Editing this file will not alter the behavior of the 
nginx syntax highlighter in NPP. You must still open the "User-Defined 
Dialogue..." menu (under "View" on the NPP toolbar) and paste the edited 
keyword list into the appropriate box on the "Keyword Lists" tab. 

The list is given here twice--one is separated by spaces (for easy 
copying + pasting); the other is separated by newline characters (for 
easy searching and readability). Both lists are sorted alphabetically. 

NOTE: These keywords use Notepad++'s "Prefix mode," which means any 
string that starts with these keywords will be highlighted as a keyword. 
For example, you do not need to include HTTP_REFERER and HTTP_HOST (or 
any other HTTP variables), because these are all matched by the "HTTP_" 
keyword.
