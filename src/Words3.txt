Words3
======

If you would like to view or edit the keywords contained in the Words3 
list, I have provided them here for your convenience. This file has no 
functional purpose. Editing this file will not alter the behavior of the 
nginx syntax highlighter in NPP. You must still open the "User-Defined 
Dialogue..." menu (under "View" on the NPP toolbar) and paste the edited 
keyword list into the appropriate box on the "Keyword Lists" tab. 

The list is given here twice--one is separated by spaces (for easy 
copying + pasting); the other is separated by newline characters (for 
easy searching and readability). 

The keywords in this list represent the main structural components of an 
nginx configuration. The first 4 keywords are the nginx "context" 
blocks, and the 5th keyword ("include") seems equally important on a 
structural level, so I included it in this list.
